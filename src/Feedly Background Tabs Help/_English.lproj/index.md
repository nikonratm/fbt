Feedly Background Tabs is a Safari Extension that allows you to set a shortcut key (default **v**) that will open a Feedly article in a new tab *behind* the current one. You can customize the key used for this by clicking the toolbar button and entering a new shortcut key. Note that if you have the extension enabled you do not need to keep the tooldbar item visible.
